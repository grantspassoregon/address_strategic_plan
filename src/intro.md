# Introduction

The Address Strategic Plan identifies issues related to existing addresses, and serves as a planning document for developing policies and strategies for resolving these issues. Address issues fall into five broad categories:

- Access (Deprecated street names)
- Address number suffixes
- Out-of-sequence numbering
- Inaccurate directional designation
- Incorrect Parity
- Inaccurate street name post type
- Inaccurate parcel situs address

Access issues, or deprecated street names, refer to addresses where the street name no longer corresponds to the street providing access to the property, and these present a concern for emergency response. Emergency responders expect the street name of the address to correspond to the named public street that provides primary access to the property.

Address number suffixes, an identifier modifying the address number such as 1/2 or 3/4, present an issue for emergency responders because the computer-aided dispatch system used by emergency response does not recognize address number suffixes.

Out-of-sequence numbering refers to address numbers that do not adhere to the numbering sequence established in the block. According to the municipal code, address numbers should increase monotonically as they get farther from the city center.

The ostensible purpose of directional designations is to help orient emergency responders navigating the city at night, but unlike the previous issues, the problems with inaccurate directional designations do not originate from emergency response issues. In this case the assessorâ€™s office differs from the City in recorded directional designation for hundreds of parcel situs addresses, and this document aims to provide clear process by which to change or confirm the directional designation of a street.

Incorrect parity means that the address number is odd when it should have been even, or vice versa.
While there is some room for interpretation of alignment for curvilinear streets, it is still possible to get the parity wrong.
The perceived risk from incorrect parity is fairly low for an individual property, but if parity is not standardized, then we lose the ability to use parity as a way to orient and direct emergency responders.
So correcting violations in parity rules helps to protect the efficacy of this strategy.

Inaccurate street name post type means that the assigned predirectional of the address does not match the official road name, as determined by the final plat.

Inaccurate parcel situs address indicates that the parcel situs address does not match the city record and should be updated.
