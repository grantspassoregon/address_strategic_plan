# SW GRANDVIEW AVE -> GRANDVIEW AVE

Addresses Affected: 22

Finding: The assessment map shows "Grandview Avenue". We have no final plat on record.

Evidence:

- [Assessment Map](https://alt.co.josephine.or.us/webapps/assessor/fetch-filedata.php?filetype=byaccount&identifier=R340042&inline=true) - "Grandview Avenue"

Options:

- Change the addresses to match the official street name: Grandview Ave
  - Addresses affected: 22
  - Titles affected: 3
- Add the "SW" directional designation to the official street name: SW Grandview Ave
  - Addresses affected: 0
  - Titles affected: 1

Recommendation: Add the "SW" directional designation to the official street name. This option minimizes disruption to residents and matches city preference for using directional designations. Grandview crosses Williams Hwy, the divisor between E and W directionals in the city. Using "SW" and "SE" helps to disambiguate between segments of Grandview.
