> On linear streets:
>
> - Locations on the north or west side of the street shall receive even numbering.
> - Locations on the south or east side of the street shall receive odd numbering.
>
> On curvilinear streets:
>
> - Numbering shall follow that of a linear street matching the preponderance of alignment along the street.
> - If the street changes alignment, numbering parity may follow that of a linear street matching the new alignment.

Description: Poplar Dr is a curvilinear with a predominantly east-west alignment, indicating that properties on the south side of the street should receive odd numbering. However, all the numbers assigned to the south side of Poplar Dr are even, with the exception of 401, which is out of sequence.
