Options:

  - Addresses affected: 67

- Add the "SE" directional designation to the official street name: SE Haviland Drive.
  - Addresses affected: 0
  - Titles affected: 54

Recommendation: Add the "SE" directional designation to the official street name. Since Grandview crosses Williams Highway, the divisor between east and west directionals, assigned directionals make it easier for responders to orient their response along the segment. This option also minimizes disruption to residents and matches city preference for using directional designations.
