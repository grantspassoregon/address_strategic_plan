## EASTWOOD LANE -> EASTWOOD DRIVE

Affected Addresses: 4

Finding: The county road centerlines layer uses Eastwood Lane along this portion, as a continuation of Eastwood Lane. The plat record shows the official road type is "Drive", forcing Eastwood Lane to transition to Eastwood Drive at the intersection with Waterstone.

Evidence:
