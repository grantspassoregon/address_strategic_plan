Options:

- Change the addresses to match the official street name.
  - Addresses affected: 107
  - Titles affected: 53
- Add the "NE" directional designation to the official street name per GPMC 6.40.020(D).
  - Addresses affected: 0
  - Titles affected: 6

Recommendation: Add the "NE" directional designation to the official street name. This option minimizes disruption to residents. In addition, Foothill Blvd continues to the east, after transitioning through Agness Ave, where it crosses the UGB and travels through the county. Adding the "NE" directional will help to distinguish this portion of Foothill Blvd from the eastern portion, preventing confusion during response.
