# Issue: Out of Sequence Numbering

Affected Addresses: 543-547 NE E ST

Description: This is a straightforward case where the address numbers fail to increase monotonically as distance from the city center increases, going from 545 down to 543, then up to 547 (see Figure 4).
Note that in this case we cannot switch 543 and 545 to resolve the issue because 543 also happens to be a duplicate address.
The reason this is difficult to resolve without the proposed language change is that changing the out-of-sequence value (543) involves also changing a neighboring address that by itself violates no addressing rules.
There being no even numbers between 545 and 547, either one or the other could adopt unit numbers (eg. 545 NE E ST UNITS A & B), or one could change its address number in addition (eg. 543 changing to 547, and the current 547 changing to 549).

## 2184-2233 SW ESTHER LN

Addresses Affected: 14

Description: The 2500-2700 blocks of Esther Lane were established in 2001 in association with the Esther's Meadow Subdivision in 2001 and the Nunnwood 2 Subdivision in 2004.  
The development of Summerfield Estates Phase 3 extended the 2700 block and assigned a 2800-block in 2016. However, the Summerfield Estates Phase 1 introduced a 2100-2200 block following the 2800-block, placing them out of sequence.

Recommendation:

- Reassign numbers within the 2800-2900 block in according with the preponderance of sequencing along the street.

## 269-709 W HARBECK RD

Addresses Affected: 26

Description: The divisor between east and west for block numbering is Williams Highway. West Harbeck Rd crosses Williams Highway at the 700/800 block. Numbers should ascend easterly for the portion of W Harbeck Rd east of Williams Highway, but currently ascend westerly. Numbering ascending westerly could be permissible as an extension of Harbeck Rd, which is ascending south. As Harbeck Rd changes alignment from north-south to east-west at the transition to West Harbeck, a natural continuation of block numbering would result in numbers ascending westerly. However, the block numbering does not continue the sequence on Harbeck Rd, which itself continues on to the south. Therefore, numbering on West Harbeck is independent of block numbering on Harbeck.

Options:

- Renumber addresses along the segment to ascend easterly.
- Accept the current numbering as pre-existing non-conforming.

Recommendation:
